**T**r**A**jectory **BA**sed RFI **S**ubtraction and **CAL**ibration (tabascal)
of radio interferometry data. A source to visibility model for RFI sources
including certain near-field effects. Visibility data is jointly calibrated and
cleaned from specific RFI contamination by modelling the RFI signal in the
visibilities.
